# Star Pattern Problems in Java

Welcome to the Star Pattern Problems directory! Here you will find a collection of Java programs that generate various star patterns using loops. These patterns are commonly used for educational purposes and can be a fun way to practice programming skills.

## Directory Structure

The Java files in this directory are organized based on the specific star pattern they generate. Each file name corresponds to the pattern it produces.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the Java files containing the star pattern programs.

2. Open the Java files in your preferred Java development environment or text editor.

3. Each Java file contains a specific star pattern problem along with the Java code to generate it using loops.

4. Copy the code from the desired Java file and use it in your Java project or compiler.

5. Run the Java program to see the output, which is included in the code comments.

## Example

```java
// Example: solidRectangle.java

public class solidRectangle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int n = 4; // Number of rows
        int m = 5; // Number of columns

        // Outer loop traversing rows
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Inner loop printing stars in columns
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                System.out.print("*"); // Print asterisk
            }
            System.out.println(" "); // Move to the next line after printing each row
        }
    }
}
